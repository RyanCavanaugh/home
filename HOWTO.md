## Issue Management

 * Unlabelled issues query should be checked daily and driven as close to zero as practical
   * **Action**: Add a coherent set of labels to all issues
   * **On track**: Less than ~30 at all times; oldest unlabelled issue should be less than 2 weeks old.
 * Unmilestoned bugs should be managed starting about a month before release
   * **Action**: Assign a milestone to every Bug-tagged issue
   * **On track**: Less than 5 if past the midpoint of a release cycle
 * Unassigned bugs in the current milestone should always be zero
   * **Action**: Assign to a dev on the team with available capacity
   * **On track**: Zero
 * Unassigned "other" in the current milestone: 
   * **Action**: Investigate (these are usually "special")
